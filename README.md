# Introduction

This project involves the analysis of a movie dataset obtained from The Movie Database (TMDb). The dataset comprises information on over 10,000 movies, including details such as budget, genre, rating, and revenue. The objective of this analysis is to gain insights into various aspects of the dataset, including genre popularity, ratings, revenue, and the impact of factors like budget and audience engagement.

The dataset used for this analysis is the TMDb dataset. It contains comprehensive information about movies, including their production details, genres, ratings, and financial performance. The dataset is provided in a structured format, making it suitable for analysis and exploration.

# Research Questions

To guide the analysis, the following research questions were posed:

1. Which genres are most popular from year to year?

2. Which genres are most popular each year?

3. Which genres received the highest ratings from year to year?

4. Which genres had the highest revenue/budget from year to year?

5. Do higher budgets lead to higher revenue?

6. What factors impact the increase in revenue?

# Methodology

The analysis followed a systematic approach:

Data Loading and Understanding: The dataset was loaded into the analysis environment, and an initial exploration was conducted to understand the structure and content of the data.

Data Wrangling: Data wrangling tasks, such as handling missing values and transforming variables, were performed to ensure the data was in a suitable format for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis: Various techniques were employed to investigate the research questions, including descriptive statistics, data visualization, and correlation analysis.
